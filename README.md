# MobileTestingTask
## Before starting to implement Mobile Automation Testing with Appium, 
### I installed :
* Android Studio
* NodeJS
* Appium Server
* Appium Inspector
* appium-doctor in CMD;
### I set up ANDROID_HOME; I created an Android Emulator (Nexus S Android 5.1.1) and a basic Maven project.
### I added appium client for java, JUnit5 for validation and ApachePOI to retrieve data from Excel into pom.xml as dependencies. `

### I used Java as my programming language.
### I used Maven as a build automation tool. Maven has pom.xml file allows me to manage my dependencies/versions easily.
### I used Page Object Model to simplify managing and maintaing my framework for myself and others; This design pattern allows me to locate web elements only once, in their respective classes so that if there are any problems with any web elements, 
### I know exactly where to go and how to fix it.
### I created Singleton Design Pattern to allow my framework to pass the same instance of my webdriver in one session.
### I created a configuration.properties type of file where I keep the important test data about my framework. 
### I keep Test data that can change the running flow of the whole framework, such as:browser, username/password, url.
### I created utility class from existing java library to read from properties type of file. (ConfigurationReader)
### I implemented BDD approach to simplify reading and understanding my framework for the non-technical teammates in my team.
### I wrote my test cases as if they are scenarios from the end users perspective in Gherkin language in my feature files.
### I implemented the actual coding logic with JAVA-SELENIUM-JUNIT... inside of my step_definitions package and it their own respective/related classes
### I triggered my framework from my runner class.
### Runner class allows me to run different types of testing suites that I created with my tags.
### I had different types of reports. But mainly I use "maven-cucumber-reporting" which is a very detailed reporting tool that has pie-charts, matrixes on which tests ### are passing and failing.
### Hooks class, where I implemented some cucumber annotations such as Before, After, beforestep, afterstep to create outline for my scenarios.
### I implemented a logic where my framework is taking a screenshot and attaching it to my report if a scenario is failing.
### I also implemented DDT using Scenario Outline and Examples.
